But beware! If that floating hourglass empties completely before the first light of dawn touches the horizon, all the worlds contained within these stories will vanish forever into nothingness... and you three will be trapped here for all eternity!'

The salty air whipped through their hair as cunning pirates with gold teeth and weathered faces surrounded them with curved cutlasses gleaming in the moonlight. Captain Blackbeard's ghost crew demanded they solve his legendary riddle or walk the plank into the shark-infested waters below. Using Sam's quick wit to distract the pirates with jokes, Lena's curiosity to discover hidden clues carved into the ship's mast, and Amir's careful planning to find their escape route, they managed to outwit the supernatural crew and leap to safety just as the phantom ship dissolved into mist.",

Each riddle tested not just their intelligence, but their understanding of friendship, love, and generosity. Amir's thoughtful nature, combined with Lena's insightful questions and Sam's ability to see things from unexpected angles, helped them unlock each mystery and earn the temple's blessing for their journey home.",

The hourglass above them shows only the tiniest trickle of sand remaining, and the eastern horizon is beginning to show the faintest hint of morning light. The talking raven guides them swiftly through the forest paths as reality begins to blur and shift around them—trees become bookshelves, forest paths transform into library aisles, and the magical realm slowly fades back into the familiar world they know. Their hearts pound with excitement and fear as they run faster than they ever have before, knowing that each second could be their last chance to return home to their families and their normal lives.",
